# Purpose
The purpose of the study is to interpret the drivers and consequences of right-wing violence due to the rise of xenophobic attacks against refugees in Germany. The number of refugees seeking asylum in Germany, as well as the number of xenophobic attacks against refugees has been on the rise. There is a need for systematic data collection and data processing in order to examine a broad range of research questions regarding xenophobic extremism in Germany. 

This dataset categorizes four types of right-wing political violence and social unrest, and shows us the frequency, geographic location, and time of these events.	

# Research Questions
1. What geographic locations within Germany have a high number of attacks against refugees?

2. What/when are the most frequent types of attacks? 

3. Is there a correlation between the type and time/date of attack, such as events that precede or follow the attack?
